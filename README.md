This project aims to use historical tournament data collected for the game “League of Legends” to create a tool that predicts the win rate of a given roster consisting of 5 players, 1 in each position in the game. The goal of creating such a tool is to help team managers form an understanding of how different players might perform with each other in the same team, so that it is easier for them to make decisions on the players they buy and look for. It is worth noting that this project is based entirely on statistics, which means it will definitely not be 100% accurate. There are so many components that go into determining a team’s win rate, aside from just the player statistics. We want this to just be a reference that team managers can look at to help them make better decisions.
